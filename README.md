# Machine-Learning-on-maximum-heart-rate

Cleveland dataset of 303 people was used to predict maximum heart rate from other predictors such as resting blood pressure, age, gender, serum cholesterol etc. Three different machine learning models such as multiple linear regression, random forest, BART was used to answer this question. Other variables were also taken into both models as confounding and precision variables. In all cases, root mean square error and R-squared was used to find the best model. In all 3 methods, ratio of training to test data set was 80 to 20.
